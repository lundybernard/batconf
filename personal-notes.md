# Configuration management for Python projects


## Abstract
Configuration management is a common pain point for Python developers,
especially as applications grow and environments become more complex.

In this presentation, we will explore these challenges in detail 
 and present best practices for managing configurations effectively. 
Finally, we’ll introduce **BatConf**, 
 a Python module built to help you address these issues. 
Through practical examples, we will demonstrate how BatConf simplifies 
 configuration tasks, and integrates seamlessly into Python projects.

## 1. Introduction (2 minutes)
- **Introduce Yourself**:
  - Lundy Bernard, Project Maintainer.
  - Background: Sr. Software Engineer, Traditional non-academic path.
- **Set the Stage**:
  - Clear, catchy statement about the problem your project addresses.
    - Config management is frequently a problem that we overlook, 
      until it suddenly becomes a critical feature.
  - Why this problem matters.
    - Hastily implemented solutions quickly become the source of more problems.
    - Configs are naturally rigid, and difficult to update once defined.
    - Serving many users: 
      - ask your friends in Operations about deploying containers.
      - ask your scientist friends about managing environment variables.
    - Localization
- **Purpose of the Talk**:
  - By the end of the talk, the audience will:
    - Understand the challenges and dangers Config Management presents.
    - Learn techniques to address these issues.
    - Have a new tool in their Python development kit.

## 2. Problem Statement (3 minutes)
- **The Problem**:
  Configuration Management (CM) is something every developer has to deal with, 
  even with very simple scripts or apps.

  Without a robust framework, 
  developers often find themselves writing redundant code
  or patching together inconsistent solutions.

  - Blank Slate problem:
    - lack of template/framework for guidance, how-to guides and walkthroughs.
  - Users with different needs: how do we make everyone happy?
  - Painting yourself into a corner:
    - CM is a hard problem
    - Incremental solutions often lead to dead-ends, and rigid code.
  - localization:
    - support for multiple languages, is a configuration problem.

- **Challenges Before This Project**:
  - Knowing where to start, lacking clear guidelines, and re-inventing the wheel.
  - How will your project serve users with different configuration needs?
    - config files, Environment variables, CLI arguments, Config management systems, ...
  - How will you handle conflicts between different config sources?
  - How will you over-write a setting for a single execution?
- **Lead into Your Solution**:
  How Batconf addresses these issues
    - It provides a structure to help you bootstrap your config management.
    - Multi-Source Configuration Merging
    - Extensability: Add new config sources to suit your needs

## 3. Project Overview (8 minutes)

- **Introduce the Project**:
  - Elevator pitch: "BatConf is a lightweight, respectful, extendable
     solution for your project's configuration management needs"

- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-Source Configuration Merging
     - Seamlessly integrate configurations from environment variables, 
       files (YAML, JSON, etc.), and command-line arguments 
       into a single unified structure.
  - Merge and Precedence Rules
    - Automatically resolve conflicts between multiple configuration sources 
      using a deterministic precedence hierarchy.
  - Environment-Aware Configurations
     - Easily adapt configurations for multiple environments 
       (e.g., development, testing, production)
  - Clean and Pythonic API
    - A simple, intuitive interface that enables developers to load, access, 
      and manage configurations with minimal boilerplate
  - Testability
    - Encourages testable configuration workflows by providing clear APIs 
      and structured configuration management.

- **Design Philosophy**:
  - Minimize dependencies: 
    - stdlib only
    - yaml is an optional extra
  - Respect your user's codebase:
    - Limit required imports to a single file
    - Provide simple, elegant API
  - Be flexable: Allow users to build the config that works for them
  - Be extendable: Allow users to utilize any config source they dream up.

## 4. Code Walkthrough (10 minutes)
In this walkthrough, I’ll focus on the core logic 
behind how `BatConf` merges configurations from multiple sources, 
demonstrating the clean API and extensibility of the library.
Ref: [Introduction
 
- **High-Level Workflow**:
  - Walk through the main workflow with code snippets:
    1. Create a Config dataclass for the project
    2. Define your get_config method
    3. Create config files
    4. Use the Configuration object to access values
- **Deep Dive into Core Functions**:
  - dataclass based configuration definition and structure
  - Integration with your CLI (argparse)
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - [Tested Example Code](https://github.com/lundybernard/batconf/tree/main/tests/example)
  - [Document Introduction](https://batconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)
  - [Quick Start Guide](https://batconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)

## 5. Results and Benefits (5 minutes)
- **Results**:
  - Demonstrate how your solution works effectively:
    - Simplifies code complexity.
    - Reduces redundant data-processing steps.
- **Comparison with Alternatives**:
  - [Dynaconf](https://www.dynaconf.com/)
    - Pros: Validation and Interpolation, nice config API
    - Cons: dependencies(vendored), and Interpolation
  - [python-decouple](https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/)
    - Pros: No dependencies, simple and straight-forward
    - Cons: Only supports ENV based configuration.
  - [ConfigParser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html)
    - Pros: It's in stdlib, Interpolation support
    - Cons: No ENV or hierarchical merge, limited supported sources. 

- **Community Impact**:
  BatConf encourages best practices in configuration management 
  by providing a clear, structured path for handling configurations, 
  making it easier for developers and scientists
  to build scalable and maintainable codebases.

## 6. Future Directions (2 minutes)
- **Planned Features**:
  - Adding more builtin sources.
  - Additional documentation and example code
  - More extensive walkthrough for setting up a new project
- **Open Challenges**:
  - Document and demonstrate multi-stage configs
    - pre-config to modify behavior of the configuration manager
    - configurable config file locations
    - allow devs to warn or fail when a config file is not found.
  - Decide if we should cache, or re-load values.  
    - Should values be changeable durring runtime?
    - maybe make the behavior configurable with a reasonable default ;)
  - Should we build a CLI to help explore configs, and bootstrap projects?

# Configuration management for Python projects


## Abstract
*** 100 words ***
[what is the general topic, and who is intended audience?]
- any kind of developer, at any stage of project (new or existing)
[what problem do you/does your tool solve?]
- like TDD, approach provides a framework for designing config mgmt as a basic 
- requirement of any application
- example project BatConf provides flexible, simple library for achieving successful config mgmt 
- in new or existing projects
[what will attendees learn from the presentation?]
- best practices for designing config management, examples/demos of how to use BatConf in 
- their own projects

Configuration management is a common pain point that affects all aspects of Python 
development, from running a single script in a notebook, integrating libraries into 
research projects, to fully scaled and deployed applications.

There isn't a good framework now, and challenges get really gnarly as projects grow,
you get more collaborators, and stuff scales.

We will explore these challenges in detail and present best practices for managing 
configurations effectively. 

Finally, we’ll introduce **BatConf**, 
 a Python module built to help you address these issues. 
Through practical examples, we will demonstrate how BatConf simplifies 
 configuration tasks, establishes sane requirements for new projects, and integrates 
seamlessly into existing Python projects.

    - Config management is frequently a problem that we overlook, 
      until it suddenly becomes a critical feature.
  - Why this problem matters.
    - Hastily implemented solutions quickly become the source of more problems.
    - Configs are naturally rigid, and difficult to update once defined.
