=======================
Welcome to BatConf
=======================

Configuration Management for Python projects, modules, applications,
and microservices.

Compose structured hierarchical configurations from multiple sources.
Enable your code to adapt seamlessly to the current context.
Allow users in different contexts to use the config source
that works best for them.

* Hierarchical priority: CLI > Environment > config file > module defaults
* Provides builtin support for common config sources:

  * CLI args
  * Environment Variables
  * Config File (ini, toml, yaml)
  * Config classes with default values
  * Fully customizeable configuration Schemas

* Easily extendable, add new sources to serve your needs.
* Set reasonable defaults, and override them as needed.
* Designed for 12-factor applications (config via Environment Variables)
